# Project-6
A crisp, clean, and functional splash screen web page. 

Page's Behavior:

The splash page has a grayscale background image that changes size relative to the size of the window.

Upon load of the page, a welcome message is displayed.

Below the background image portion of the page is a button that when clicked will display a message and shift the text to the right.
