      <h3> Award-Winning Middle-Out Compression</h3>

<p>Our revolutionary middle-out compression was the missing piece preventing Peter and Gavin from pursuing their original patent. After shattering the theoretical limit of compression at TechCrunch Disrupt, we’re now able to transport even the most complex data files across our network within seconds.‎ </p>

    <h3> Pied Piper is Born </h3>
    <p> Before Pied Piper envisioned a new internet, it was a simple app to detect infringement of music copyrights – a side project of lowly Hooli employee Richard Hendricks. But buried within this consumer-facing service was something much more valuable: a world-beating compression algorithm.<br> Once others caught wind of the promise of his algorithm, Richard found himself in the middle of a bidding war between two of the Valley’s major players. Hooli CEO Gavin Belson pounced with a ten million dollar acquisition offer, while VC Peter Gregory offered a $200,000 seed round to start a new company. The stress of the decision took a physical toll on Richard, but in the end he picked Gregory and the power to see his tech through to its fullest potential.<br> 
With the backing of Gregory’s fund Raviga, Hendricks assembled his team: Dinesh Chugtai, Bertram Gilfoyle, and Jared Dunn, all working together out of Erlich Bachman’s incubator. The company’s first great test came at TechCrunch Disrupt. After a challenge from Hooli’s compression competitor Nucleus, Richard pulled an all-nighter to invent a new approach to compression: middle-out. In the finals of the competition, Richard’s middle-out algorithm surpassed the theoretical limit and achieved the highest Weissman score ever recorded. Pied Piper took first place at Disrupt.</p>

     <h3> A Lawsuit Scares Suitors </h3>
    <p>Pied Piper’s moment of triumph didn’t last long. Their champion Peter Gregory passed away and Gavin Belson slapped the team with a massive lawsuit, rendering them damaged goods to all potential investors. Fortunately, Richard came across Russ Hanneman, the one man in the Valley who didn’t wince at impending litigation. 
After a string of failed deals with energy drink Homicide and adult content producer Intersite, a condor egg live stream changed everything. The feed of the egg went viral when a camera technician fell forty feet into a ravine, and Pied Piper’s durability under the traffic proved the strength of the tech. The good news seemed to continue from there: Pied Piper defeated Gavin’s frivolous lawsuit, and Raviga’s new head VC Laurie Bream bought Hanneman out of Pied Piper.</p>

        <div class="single_block"> 
     <h3> The Platform </h3>
    <p> But the celebration didn’t last long – Bream swiftly used her power to remove Richard from his position as CEO. Richard was repositioned to CTO, and was replaced by exec-for-hire “Action” Jack Barker. After an unsuccessful attempt to pivot Pied Piper to building data storage boxes, Barker too fell victim to Laurie’s axe, and Richard was restored to the CEO chair. <br>

Under Richard’s leadership, the team launched the beta of their much-anticipated platform. However, the public response was one of confusion – they were ahead of their time. Bream fire-sold the company to Bachmanity, Erlich Bachman and Nelson Bighetti Jr.’s venture fund. And while the platform had floundered, the compression algorithm found a successful new home in a video chat app hacked by Dinesh.</p>
